## Chapter 4 - Module Loaders - Handling CSS (bundling CSS into a separate file)

**NOTE: Rendering CSS in the HTML from JS can be slow process comparing to downloading it as a separate**

* In the second part of HANDLING CSS, we will tweak the build process to get a separate CSS file to put in our HTML file. To do so, we will need yet another module in our build process `extract-text-webpack-plugin`, along with `css-loader` and `style-loader` as mentioned in part 1 of Handling CSS (Chapter 003).

* To install this new module
  `$ npm i -D extract-text-webpack-plugin`

* This module, called `extract-text-webpack-plugin`, will take a reference to loader, run webpack with it and will take any text that was generated by that loader and save it in a separate file in our output directory

* First `require` the plugin at the top as 
  `var extractTextPlugin = require('extract-text-webpack-plugin');`

* Update the **CSS RULES** in **module** property as

  ```javascript
    {
      loader: extractTextPlugin.extract({
        loader: 'css-loader'
      }),
      test: /\.css$/
    }
  ```

* After update the rule, we need to add another property to `config` object beneath `module` property as
  ```javascript
    plugins: [
      new extractTextPlugin('style.css')
    ]
  ```

* That's it! Now you can build webpack using command
  `$ npm run build`
  and new `style.css` file is generated in the `dist` folder which needs to be included in `index.html` manually.

* This new generated `style.css` contains styles of all of the css files which include in JS files during workflow.
